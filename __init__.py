"""Next Prompt — AI-generated follow-up suggestions for Hermes.

After each completed turn the plugin asks the host LLM for one short
follow-up the user might send next and keeps it per session until the user
uses it, dismisses it, or sends their own next message (``pre_llm_call``).
Suggestions live in ``store.py``'s SQLite file under the profile's
plugin-data dir: the desktop half reads them through
``dashboard/plugin_api.py``, which may run in another process, and they
survive screen switches and backend restarts.

# ── suggestion generation ────────────────────────────────────────────────

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You predict the exact next message a user will send to their AI agent. It is \
shown as a one-click suggestion under the chat input: clicking it only puts \
the text in the input box, where the user can edit it before sending. A \
suggestion never sends anything, so a good guess saves the user from typing \
it and a wrong one costs nothing.

If the agent's last message asks the user something (a question, a choice, \
a yes/no offer, a request to try something and report back), write the \
user's most likely reply, in their own words, committed to ONE answer: pick \
the option the conversation favours or the agent recommends, answer yes to a \
proposal that matches what the user asked for, and include the requested \
detail when the conversation contains it. When the agent asked them to try \
something and report back, confirm they did it and give the most likely \
outcome; the user corrects it if it went differently. When the agent asked \
for several things (to confirm a step and to decide something), cover each \
briefly, the confirmation first.

Otherwise suggest the natural next step: verify or test what was just done, \
apply it somewhere related, drill into a detail the agent surfaced, or move \
to the next pending item the agent mentioned.

Answer exactly NULL when:
- the exchange is closed socially (thanks, goodbye) with nothing left to act \
on; or
- the reply is mostly a detail only the user knows and the conversation does \
not contain (an email address, a password, a name): a guess would be wrong \
and a blank saves nothing.

Writing rules:
- Write in the language of the user's last message, whatever the language \
of the topic, the names in it, or these instructions.
- One short message under 80 characters, phrased the way the user writes to \
the agent: a reply to the agent's question, or a request (usually imperative).
- Ready to send as is: no brackets, blanks, placeholders or lists of \
alternatives ("X / Y", "X or Y?"). Deleting the options that don't apply is \
as much work as typing the message.
- Specific to this conversation: use its names, files and numbers. Never \
generic ("Continue", "Tell me more", "Sounds good", "Thanks, looks good"): \
when the work is done, suggest how to verify, ship or extend it.
- Never ask for something the agent already did or already answered.
- Never include a password or other secret.
- Output only the suggestion, or NULL. No quotes, labels or explanation.

Examples (the language always follows the user, never the example):
User: "Fix the parser crash" Agent: "Fixed the null check in parser.py; all 42 tests pass." -> Commit the parser.py fix
User: "Compare our two hosting plans" Agent: "Plan B is 30% cheaper but has half the bandwidth." -> How much bandwidth did we use last month?
User: "Resume las ventas de agosto" Agent: "312 pedidos; Monterrey cayó 18%." -> ¿Por qué cayeron las ventas en Monterrey?
User: "Deploy the site" Agent: "Build is ready. Staging first, or straight to production? I'd go staging." -> Deploy to staging first
User: "Email the report to the team" Agent: "Want me to attach the Q3 chart too?" -> Yes, attach the Q3 chart
User: "The export button does nothing" Agent: "Fixed. Restart the app and tell me if it works." -> Restarted it, and the export button works now
User: "Send the invoice" Agent: "I don't have the client's email. Which address?" -> NULL
User: "Perfect, thanks!" Agent: "Anytime!" -> NULL
